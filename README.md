# Parallel Matrix Multiplication
This project focuses on how to use “parallel for” and optimize a matrix-matrix multiplication to gain better performance. C++ and OpenMP library will be used.

## Performance Metrics

The performance metrics analyzed include speedup and parallel efficiency for matrix multiplication using OpenMP.

## How to Execute

1. Open Ubuntu Terminal via WSL.
2. Change the path towards the required program.
3. Use 'g++ -fopenmp file_name.cpp -o file_name' to read file.
4. Use './file_name' to execute.
