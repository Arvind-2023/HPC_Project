# Parallel Matrix Multiplication
This project focuses on how to use “parallel for” and optimize a matrix-matrix multiplication to gain better performance. C++ and OpenMP library will be used.

## Performance Metrics

The performance metrics analyzed include speedup and parallel efficiency for matrix multiplication using OpenMP.
